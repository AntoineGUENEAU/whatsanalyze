Wanna use a real privacy-focused messenger? Signal is the way to go. Even [Edward Snowden uses it every day](https://www.signal.org/)!

- sticker packs
- groups
- **no ads & no trackers**
- free, powered by donations (Signal is a nonprofit)

## Why switch from WhatsApp to Signal

WhatsApp is from Facebook. And Facebook has a _really_ bad track record of respecting the private data of their users. Even though Facebook can't read your WhatsApp messages, they do track you and analyze what you do. They use the data to sell it to third parties to improve their ads business. I certainly do not want that. So that's why I switched to signal. Here is how you can switch to WhatsApp too:

### Download Signal from their Website

Go to -> https://www.signal.org/

Create a new account. Now you can start using it right away! There also is a Tablet, Mac, and Windows application for it.

Signal offers no functionality to import any data. You need to start with a blank state and can not have your old WhatsApp chats in Signal.

If you, however, want to backup your data you [export your WhatsApp data](https://whatsanalyze.com/how-to-export-your-whatsapp-chat) and then run it through our tool and save it as a PDF!


In that way, you can keep your chats as a PDF and have a secure, privacy-focused messenger!
